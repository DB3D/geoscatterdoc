          release-notes: This relatively small update fixes a few bugs, a crash,
          and improves some features. <br />
          With this update also comes an important platform improvement consisting
          of the following:
        </li>
        <li class="faq_nested_li">We launched www.geoscatter.com</li>
        <li class="faq_nested_li">
          All biomes available are now elegantly displayed within

          us.
        </li>
        <li class="faq_nested_li">
          We released our free "Biome-Reader" plugin, a dumbed-down version of
          Geo-Scatter available for all b3d users. Users will be able to install,
          read, and scatter biomes freely. Biome-Reader can be downloaded for free
          at www.geoscatter.com/download/. Please do not install both plugins
          simultaneously.
        </li>
        <li class="faq_nested_li">
          The old "starter library" that used to be shipped with our plugin has
          been improved:
        </li>
        <li class="faq_nested_li">
          <b>
            We reworked most assets and textures to create a higher-quality
            collection of plants. It's now standalone and rebranded as "The Plant
            Library"</b>, it's free and accessible to all blender users! Why? We do not want to
          sell vegetation, this library was always meant to be a demonstration of
          the capabilities of our plugin, and now it serves as a very good
          introduction to our Biome system. Checkout the differences!
        </li>
        <li class="faq_nested_li">
          The old library will now be considered as "Legacy", rest assured it will
          still be available for download within the new product page. Both on the
          blender-market or gumroad.
        </li>
        <li class="faq_nested_li">
          The Winter and Tree assets are currently missing from this rework, we
          intend to update them later on.
        </li>
        <li class="faq_nested_li">
          The biomes also have been reworked, there are fewer, but they are much
          better in terms of quality. Compare by yourself: old biomes vs new
          biomes. <br />
          Both can be installed simultaneously.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>mprovement: </b> You'll no longer see "Scatter5" in the plugin name
          or in your collections.
          <b>Please make sure to uninstall older "Scatter5" plugins first. </b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>improvement:</b> New notification system, a new panel will appear if
          context informations are needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>improvement: </b> better viewlayers management system, the plugin
          will not change viewlayers automatically, the viewlayers will stay
          intact per scenes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>improvement:</b> now we have four various ways users can switch
          emitters in each panels headers. We added an "emitter-switch menu".
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>improvement:</b> You'll be also able to switch emitters from the
          quick lister menu (<span>CTRL+SHIFT+Q</span> by default)
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>improvement:</b> Quick scatter pie menu is back, users didn't like
          the shortcut-based operator we introduced recently.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>improvement:</b> Better security behavior warnings will now let you
          the ability to undo default behavior.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>improvement:</b> Licenses written within the plugin preferences, &
          extra indication if the user is holding Individual/Team/Studio variants.

          <p>
            <b>release-notes:</b> Important Bugfix Release, and smaller feature
            improvements, please prefer using 5.3.1 over 5.3. Refer to version 5.3
            for requirements. Did you know that we are the first scattering plugin
            for blender? Back then we simply chose to name our plugin "Scatter".
            <b> We will now call ourselves "Geo-Scatter"</b>. Why "Geo"? Because
            of the act of scattering 3D geometry, and the fact that our plugin is
            built on a powerful geometry-node pipeline! We sincerely hope that you
            like our new name.

            <b>improvement:</b> &nbsp;Previously, biomes were forced to store all
            their assets in a single .blend per layer, it is no longer the case.
            Now, a single biome layer can contain many assets from many different
            .blend files. This version will be a <b>requirement</b> for all
            upcoming biomes pack releases,
            <b>newer biome packs will probably not be readable in older versions

            <b>release-notes:</b> This update consists of major improvements to
            our plugin features, interface, and pipeline. Most importantly, the
            multi-surface scattering implementation.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>new-feature:</b> One of the most ambitious features we worked on so
            far, is the integration of a
            <b>multi-surface scattering ability,</b> which we rigorously
            implemented deep into our scattering workflow! That's a first for
            blender plugins, here are a few implementation examples:
          </p>
          <ul style="margin-left: 15px">
            <li>
              <p>
                All our features have been adapted in order to work in the global
                world-space, or per individual surface space.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The ability to distribute in local <b> 𝗼𝗿 </b> global space has
                been preserved! Working with <b>animated surfaces</b> is possible,
                as we'll keep the density stable with the local space option.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Some inputs will be highlighted in red if a mesh-attribute (vertex
                group/ vertex color/uv layer) is not shared across all of your
                surfaces.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                We made sure painting vertex masks on many surfaces is a smooth
                experience. When creating or painting masks, the plugin will
                ensure that the attribute is shared across all of your chosen
                surfaces &amp; will be set as active automatically.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The creation operators now have a "future surfaces" option in
                their creation popovers.

            <li>
              <p>
                Manual mode also accepts many surfaces as one large painting
                canvas. The scattered points will be automatically attached to
                each parent-surface. Swapping surfaces won't remove the created
                points.

                effect is quite overlooked in most scattering plugins, even in
                other 3d software, and it is quite essential in order to reach a

<div class="article_content gmstyling">
  <h2>Compatibility Advices</h2>
  <br>
  <p>
    ✅ Please verify your blender plugin compatibility before installing
    anything. Plugins are not compatible with any blender versions.
    <br />
    ✅ The best demeanor with any software is to stick working on your projects
    on the same version from start to end.
    <br />
    ⛔ Never read a blend file from a higher version in a lower version of
    blender. It's called forward compatibility, saving might corrupt your file
    forever.

                  new-feature: We implemented a master seed in the extra panel
                  that has an influence on every other scatter5 seed of your
                  blend file. <br />Changing this seed is a fast way to iterate

                <p>
                  new-feature: New "Stable deform" distribution mode. This
                  distribution method is based on UV space and is ideal when you
                  are actively deforming/animating your emitting surface, as the
                  location of instances will stay stable.

        <p>
          new-feature: Scatter5 can automatically hide the system(s) when hiding
          the emitter. <br />This update behavior is available on the 'Extra'
          panel, it will be turned off by default.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          new-feature: The placeholders now have preview icons and we added 10
          new placeholder objects. This means you might need to re-select your
          previous placeholder object when converting a scatter system from 5.0
          or 5.1.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          new-feature: New "Boundary" tangent alignment feature, ideal for
          hard-surface scatter where instances should stay aligned according to
          the surface boundary edges.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          new-feature: All Scatter5 properties now partially support
          keyframes/drivers. Be aware that blender will store this animation
          data depending on your scatter system list order, this is sadly a
          blender limitation that we cannot change.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          new-feature: New "Face Preview" visibility feature. Useful when
          working with large emitter surfaces, as you are able to sample a
          preview area on the viewport and render the full area on render.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          new-feature: The "Remove Near" feature now has an extra "Consider

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          improvement: The camera update dependencies are now set on the 'halt'
          mode by default. It is now also possible to set a custom update rate.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          improvement: The collections pointer properties now have an "Add"
          operator to quickly create a collection containing the selected
          objects.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          improvement: Clearly comprehend which categories of settings are being

        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          improvement: All our modal operators now have a new info box interface
          to display shortcuts or other information.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          improvement: The enter manual mode operator now retains the last
          brushes used.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>improvement: Better performance when hiding scatter system(s).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          improvement: A new warning message subpanel will appear when needed in
          the tweaking panel.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          improvement: Working on multiple unique scenes is now fully supported.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          improvement: Linking a scatter_obj from another file is now fully
          supported.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          improvement: The property math operation is now also supported on
          other distribution modes, and on the default scale feature.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
