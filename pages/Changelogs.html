      <li>
        <b>Release-Notes: </b>In this major release, we introduce 3 new distribution methods and important new features, such as ecosystem density, or proximity imprint simulation and many others changes, improvements, and fixes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Compatibility-Notes: </b>Some settings have changed since previous versions, expect changes when updating your scatters.<br />
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>New-Feature: </b> 3 new distribution methods
        <ul> 
          <li>‘Bezier-Area’ Scatter within the inner area of a selected bezier object, then optionally project the distribution into your chosen surface(s). Because the distribution is generated first on a curve object, then projected on your surface(s) the workflow allows you to distribute on areas of extremely large terrains with no issues.</li>
          <li>‘Bezier-Spline’ Scatter on a chosen spline, with various options and submethods available. Option to project on your chosen surface(s) also available. This distribution method is also available on the 'on creation' settings menu located in the creation panel: You are able to directly paint a curve spline mask for biomes if the paint method is set to draw spline.</li>
          <li>‘Empties’ Choose a collection of empties, and instantiate objects on them. Option to project on your chosen surface(s) also available.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>New-Feature:</b> Rework of the ‘In Volume’ distribution method. Now supporting random or grid distribution submethod.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>New-Feature:</b> New 'Efficient Distribution' option available for the camera culling feature. Enabled by default, this option significantly boost your compute speed when working with large terrains.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>New-Feature:</b> New ecosystem density feature, scatter only on dense/scarce areas of chosen scatter-systems.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>New-Feature:</b> New manual mode brushes
        <ul> 
          <li>‘Line’ distribution brush. Draw points at regular interval along a straight line projected from the global Z axis.</li>
          <li>‘Lasso Delete’ removal brush. A new lasso deletion brush.</li>
          <li>‘Push’ translation brush. Push manually distributed instances around depending on the direction of your brush-strokes.</li>
          <li>‘Split’ translation brush. Create a pathway between manually distributed instances. Press CTRL for the reverse effect.</li>
          <li>‘Attract’ translation brush. Attract manually distributed instances together. Press CTRL for the reverse effect.</li>
          <li>‘Turbulence’ translation brush. Randomly push the location of manually distributed instances around, great if you'd like to create a random.</li>
          <li>‘Relax’ translation brush improvement. The relax algorithm is much faster and better at offsetting manually distributed instances at equidistant locations.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>New-Feature:</b> New 'smoothing' options, handy if you'd like your effects to not be influenced by the slightest mesh imperfection of your surface(s). Available for the 'rotation align normal/tangent downslope' and 'abiotic slope/orientation/curvature' features. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>New-Feature:</b> Enhanced and improved Wind-waves features with new options and sliders. You are now able to create wind patterns that also tilt on its sides instead of tilting unilaterally facing the general wind-wave texture direction.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>New-Feature:</b> New proximity simulation imprint option for the proximity repel features. Create an imprint effect from passing colliders. (This option requires an animation running).
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>New-Feature:</b> Automatic data-transfer of surfaces attributes when using these new distribution methods, also for manual mode distribution. (previously it was required of users to click on an operator to transfer the surface's attributes).
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>New-Feature:</b> New methods for the align X/Y axis features, in order to align the rotation instances to the active camera.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>New-Feature:</b> Improvement of the offset features. Now featuring new local/global spaces methods, seeds, and a reworked 'random' offset method, previously called 'noise animation'.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>New-Feature:</b> For features relying on the active camera (such as camera visibility) the camera update behavior drop-down enum now features a new ‘real-time’ option. When choosing this option, the Geometry-node scatter engine will use the recently added 'Active Camera' input node instead of relying on our plugin constantly feeding camera transforms information. So use this feature if you'd like to send your .blend file to a cloud render.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>New-Feature: </b> Better in-between files scatter's management
        <ul> 
          <li>We now support appending/linking scatters from other .blend files. To do so, simply append or link scatter_obj or emitters from your other files.</li>
          <li>We now support duplicating scenes containing scatters. Behavior when scattering across multiple scenes is improved.</li>
          <li>We now support cross ‘.blend’ file copy/pasting of objects containing scatter systems. Use the CtrlC/CtrlV shortcuts on an emitter or a scatter object ('scatter_obj' objects containing the instances scatters) from one file to another.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>New-Feature:</b> New universal feature mask image paint method. Define your feature influence area with the help of an image. We also slightly changed the feature masks interface, it now uses a toggle button, default set to False, instead of a drop down set to 'None'.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Improvement:</b> Official support for the new extension system (you can now drag and drop a plugin .zip directly into blender 4.2+ to install.)
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Improvement:</b> Scatter-Engine rework, we have improved our geometry-node Scatter-Engine to support the new 'matrix 4x4' socket. Most transforms information are now stored as matrix attributes or field noodles instead of vectors resulting in performance enhancements.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Improvement:</b> The scatter-system(s) lister interface colors now supports alpha values. If you set your blender viewport display colors to 'object' you'll be able to adjust the transparency of your scatter-layers by tweaking the color alpha value.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Improvement:</b> Enhance scatter export operators, convert scatters into real blender objects from a newly designed dialog box operator located in the extra panel, or in the system lister drop-down menu.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Improvement:</b> Better error notification and management-system for missing scatter_obj or emitters or else. You'll get notified & directly proposed a solution if a problem were to occur.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Improvement:</b> New default user-interface look consisting of checkbox buttons with icons. If you don’t like this style, disable ‘use toggles with icons’ in the plugin preferences.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Improvement:</b> Scattering the selected assets will now consider the selection across all possible open asset-browser editors instead of picking the first one found.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Improvement:</b> New ‘animation data’ interface in the extra panel in order to easily overview the currently animated plugin properties via drivers or keyframes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Improvement:</b> The visibility frustrum culling feature now supports blender horizontal or vertical sensor fit method camera data options.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Improvement:</b> The Copy/paste systems operation located in system lister drop-down menu now supports manual mode scatters as well.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Improvement:</b> Conformity to 'bpy.app.online_access'. The plugin won't connect to the internet to load available scatpacks icons if blender is on offline mode.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Improvement:</b> It is now possible to have negative seed properties values.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Improvement:</b> Added the ability to choose a local or global space for the noise features masks.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Improvement:</b> Improved responsiveness when tweaking Vector or Color scatter properties.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Improvement:</b> We added new 'helper' placeholders to the placeholder list (in the 'Display As' feature). Two new placeholders are available: A triangular tangent green arrow, and a normal blue arrow.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Improvement:</b> Biome creators can now set custom python instructions on biome-loading operations. A new "script" dictionary need to be added in the .biome json file manually via a text editor. This dict should contain an "operation_name" string value as well as a "file_name" value being the name of the script the creator want to execute during loading. This script will have access to the variables 'psys', 'surfaces' and 'emitter'.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Improvement:</b> We rewrote, added, and enhanced most of 'on hover' descriptions. To learn more about features, sliders and options, hover over their properties in the interface with your mouse while staying still for half a second. You should be able to understand features without the need of using this documentation website
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>improvement: </b> Addon-preferences properties improvements
        <ul> 
          <li>You can now import or export your Geo-Scatter plugin settings as '.geoscattersettings' files. Great to save your settings and shortcuts saved across multiple versions of Geo-Scatter, or across many computers.</li>
          <li>Our plugin can now support multiple languages. You are able to swap between languages if a translation '.csv' file is found in the directory '..plugins/Geo-Scatter/translations/'.</li>
          <li>A new option to fully hide 'scatter_obj' modifiers in addition to their object viewport status is available in the Geo-Scatter plugin preferences. By default only the scatter_obj will be hidden in the viewport, you can use this option to force hide also the scatter_obj geometry node modifiers, this will save up some evaluation time therefore saving on performances.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Bugfix:</b> Operator-override error fix, when trying to open the biome-manager.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Bugfix:</b> Operator-override error fix, when using operators of the procedural vertex-group workflow.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Bugfix:</b> Important fixes on keyframes/drivers animated plugin properties. Because blender encode animation data of any plugin's PropertyGroup in an orderly manner, deleting a scatter would've resulted in a re-order of the scattering system's PropertyGroup therefore making any animation data incorrect. While there's no direct way to fix this issue, we've found an indirect solution to this problem. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Bugfix:</b> Creating a new empty emitter thrown errors. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Bugfix:</b> We tweaked the behavior of the clump rotation normal influence slider, this only applies to clump distribution method. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Bugfix:</b> Batch randomizing scatters led to changes in clump-distribution densities. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Bugfix:</b> Interface error if no instancing collection was chosen. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Bugfix:</b> For our textures-data system, we fixed the visualizer, as it sometimes produced inaccurate projection-transforms.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Bugfix:</b> Fixed wrong texture muscgrave_type to noise_type since blender musgrave textures are gone. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Bugfix:</b> Fixing few bugs related to manual-distribution mode. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Bugfix:</b> Inaccurate final render statistics. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Bugfix:</b> Inaccurate calculations if setting a transition slider to 0.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Bugfix:</b> Fixing an 'offset falling animation' property still active if the rotation sub-option was disabled.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Note:</b> Some of you reported an unjustified lag when playing an animation, we reported this issue, and it is related to a blender geometrynode bug. (See <a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/111200" target="_blank">Report</a>)
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Note:</b> For the new bezier-spline distribution method, we are aware of a blender geometry-node bug where the curve incline won't follow the curve-tilt data in global space. (See <a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/126283" target="_blank">Report</a>)
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Note:</b> If you used the 5.5 BETA and saved some .blend files with it, please use the 'Force-Update' button located in the plugin manager preferences to update your blend file with the official released 'Scatter-Engine MKV'.

  <h1>Compatibility Advices</h1>
  <p>It's important to follow these advices for an issue free experience!</p>
</div>

<div class="article_content gmstyling">
  <h2>Compatibility Advices</h2>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li>✅ Please verify your Blender plugin compatibility before installing
      anything. Plugins are not compatible with any Blender versions.
    </li>
    <li>✅ The best demeanor with any software is to stick working on your projects
      on the same version from start to end.
    </li>
    <li>⛔ Never read a blend file from a higher version in a lower version of
      Blender.<br/>It's called a forward compatibility error, saving might corrupt your file forever.
    </li>
  </ul>

      <li>
        <b>Release-Notes:</b> This relatively small update fixes a few bugs, a crash,
        and improves some features. <br />
        With this update also comes an important platform improvement consisting
        of the following:
      </li>
      <li>We launched www.geoscatter.com</li>
      <li>
        All biomes available are now elegantly displayed within
        www.geoscatter.com/biomes take a peek!
      </li>
      <li>
        Change in our licensing: Our scripts are indeed released under GNU GPL,
        however, our geometry-node engine is released under a license similar to
        royalty-free,
        <b>with the added benefit granting licensees the ability to freely share
          a scene containing the engine, and the added restriction to prohibit
          interaction with our nodes through scripts coming from unknown
          sources.</b>
        Please read www.geoscatter.com/legal for the complete legal agreement.
        If you have questions regarding this license, don't hesitate to reach
        us.
      </li>
      <li>
        We released our free "Biome-Reader" plugin, a dumbed-down version of
        Geo-Scatter available for all b3d users. Users will be able to install,
        read, and scatter biomes freely. Biome-Reader can be downloaded for free
        at www.geoscatter.com/download/. Please do not install both plugins
        simultaneously.
      </li>
      <li>
        The old "starter library" that used to be shipped with our plugin has
        been improved:
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>
          We reworked most assets and textures to create a higher-quality
          collection of plants. It's now standalone and rebranded as "The Plant
          Library"</b>, it's free and accessible to all Blender users! Why? We do not want to
        sell vegetation, this library was always meant to be a demonstration of
        the capabilities of our plugin, and now it serves as a very good
        introduction to our Biome system. Checkout the differences!
      </li>
      <li>
        The old library will now be considered as "Legacy", rest assured it will
        still be available for download within the new product page. Both on the
        Blender-market or gumroad.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Winter and Tree assets are currently missing from this rework, we
        intend to update them later on.
      </li>
      <li>
        The biomes also have been reworked, there are fewer, but they are much
        better in terms of quality. Compare by yourself: old biomes vs new
        biomes. <br />
        Both can be installed simultaneously.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>improvement: </b> You'll no longer see "Scatter5" in the plugin name
        or in your collections.
        <b>Please make sure to uninstall older "Scatter5" plugins first. </b>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Improvement:</b> New notification system, a new panel will appear if
        context informations are needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>improvement: </b> better viewlayers management system, the plugin
        will not change viewlayers automatically, the viewlayers will stay
        intact per scenes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Improvement:</b> now we have four various ways users can switch
        emitters in each panels headers. We added an "emitter-switch menu".
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Improvement:</b> You'll be also able to switch emitters from the
        quick lister menu (<span>CTRL+SHIFT+Q</span> by default)
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Improvement:</b> Quick scatter pie menu is back, users didn't like
        the shortcut-based operator we introduced recently.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Improvement:</b> Better security behavior warnings will now let you
        the ability to undo default behavior.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Improvement:</b> Licenses written within the plugin preferences, &
        extra indication if the user is holding Individual/Team/Studio variants.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Bugfix:</b> Inaccurate rendering view states for optimization
        features.
      </li>
      <li><b>Bugfix:</b> Manual mode instances disappearance.</li>
      <li><b>Bugfix:</b> Camera clipping stops working.</li>

      <li><b>Bugfix:</b> Keyframing vectorial values didn't work.</li>
      <li>
        <b>Bugfix:</b> Crash on keyframes animations & other animation crashes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Bugfix:</b> Snow animation playback even if all scatter-system(s) of
        your scene is hidden .
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Bugfix:</b> Fixed the need to constantly reload your biome-library
        when opening new .blends.

        <p>
          <b>Release-Notes:</b> Important Bugfix Release, and smaller feature
          improvements, please prefer using 5.3.1 over 5.3. Rebranding: Did you know that we are the first scattering plugin
          for Blender? Back then we simply chose to name our plugin "Scatter".
          <b> We will now call ourselves "Geo-Scatter"</b>. Why "Geo"? Because
          of the act of scattering 3D geometry, and the fact that our plugin is
          built on a powerful geometry-node pipeline! We sincerely hope that you
          like our new name.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>New-Feature:</b> New operator that can convert all .blend files in
          the selected folder to an asset-browser compatible format. This option
          is located in the plugin manager &gt; preferences.&nbsp;
        </p>

      <li>
        <p>
          <b>Improvement:</b> Greatly improved the biome environment path

        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>Improvement:</b> &nbsp;Previously, biomes were forced to store all
          their assets in a single .blend per layer, it is no longer the case.
          Now, a single biome layer can contain many assets from many different
          .blend files. This version will be a <b>requirement</b> for all
          upcoming biomes pack releases,
          <b>newer biome packs will probably not be readable in older versions
            of our plugin.</b>

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>Improvement:</b> Security-actions overhaul. The plugin will now ask
          you if you would like to enable some optimization features instead of
          simply warning you.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>Improvement:</b> Ability to export biomes that are using many

      <br>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>Release-Notes:</b> This update consists of major improvements to
          our plugin features, interface, and pipeline. Most importantly, the
          multi-surface scattering implementation.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Compatibility-Notes: </b>Some settings have changed since previous versions, expect changes when updating your scatters.<br />
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          <b>New-Feature:</b> One of the most ambitious features we worked on so
          far, is the integration of a
          <b>multi-surface scattering ability,</b> which we rigorously
          implemented deep into our scattering workflow! That's a first for
          Blender plugins, here are a few implementation examples:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              All our features have been adapted in order to work in the global
              world-space, or per individual surface space.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The ability to distribute in local <b> or</b> global space has
              been preserved! Working with <b>animated surfaces</b> is possible,
              as we'll keep the density stable with the local space option.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Some inputs will be highlighted in red if a mesh-attribute (vertex
              group/ vertex color/uv layer) is not shared across all of your
              surfaces.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              We made sure painting vertex masks on many surfaces is a smooth
              experience. When creating or painting masks, the plugin will
              ensure that the attribute is shared across all of your chosen
              surfaces &amp; will be set as active automatically.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The creation operators now have a "future surfaces" option in
              their creation popovers.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Manual mode also accepts many surfaces as one large painting
              canvas. The scattered points will be automatically attached to
              each parent-surface. Swapping surfaces won't remove the created
              points.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>New-Feature:</b> &nbsp;We implemented new
          <b>transition falloff controls</b>
          everywhere in our toolset. This implementation consists of two new
          functionalities:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Transition-graph, useful for defining user-defined transitions
              falloff. &nbsp;When interacting with the graph, we do support
              the<a href="#"
                data-doc="#FeaturePrerequisite&article_batch_operation">
                ALT-for-bach </a>&amp;
              <a href="#"
                data-doc="#FeaturePrerequisite&article_batch_operation">settings-synchronization</a>
              features.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Transition-noise, blend your transition with a noise pattern. This
              effect is quite overlooked in most scattering plugins, even in
              other 3d software, and it is quite essential in order to reach a
              more natural-looking transition in our opinion!&nbsp;
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>New-Feature:</b> Instance count.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              You are now able to distribute instances based on a density
              (/m&sup2;) or by a total instance count slider.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Calculate the total number of instances shown on screen/render in
              the visibility category, or in the plugin manager lister
              interface.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              New "Max amount" visibility feature. Automatically prevent your
              scatter to reach a given instance count threshold.&nbsp;
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>New-Feature:</b> We added a new "display as point cloud" option,
          this display method is quite promising and very useful to understand
          the final shape of your distribution while taking advantage of the
          very fast point drawing. Note that
          <a href="https://developer.blender.org/T93245" target="_blank">T93245</a>

          <a href="https://developer.blender.org/T92963" target="_blank">T92963</a>
          are important issues that need to be solved by the Blender developers.
        </p>

      <li>
        <p><b>Improvement:</b> Better Camera Optimization.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>The camera frustum will adapt automatically, by default.</p>

      <li>
        <p><b>Improvement:</b> Better proximity features.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              The "remove near" and "lean near" features have been merged into a

          <li>
            <p>
              The "outskirt" feature is much faster (be aware that it is still

                  that has an influence on every other scatter5 seed of your
                  blend file. <br />Changing this seed is a fast way to iterate
                  on your environment design (Pro tip: you can animate this seed

                  <b>New-Feature:</b> New "Stable deform" distribution mode. This
                  distribution method is based on UV space and is ideal when you
                  are actively deforming/animating your emitting surface, as the
                  location of instances will stay stable.
                </p>

                  following the edge direction. An extra "edge length influence"
                  feature is available in the scale category.&nbsp;

          panel, it will be turned off by default.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>New-Feature:</b> The placeholders now have preview icons and we added 10
          new placeholder objects. This means you might need to re-select your
          previous placeholder object when converting a scatter system from 5.0
          or 5.1.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>

          the surface boundary edges.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>New-Feature:</b> All Scatter5 properties now partially support
          keyframes/drivers. Be aware that Blender will store this animation
          data depending on your scatter system list order, this is sadly a
          Blender limitation that we cannot change.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>New-Feature:</b> New "Face Preview" visibility feature. Useful when
