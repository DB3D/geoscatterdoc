      <h2>ABC's of Blender</h2>
      <p>
        Do you understand what is a vertex, what is a 'Mesh'? What is a UVMap and how to create
        simple UV's? How to add/remove modifiers? What is the normal direction of
        a face and its implications on shading? Why you can't
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMIwthFmr-Q" target="_blank">a vertex attribute</a>
        correctly on a low poly object? Great! Let's get started then!
      </p>
    </div>

      <h2>Apply Scales</h2>
      <p>
        Let's say you created a plane in your scene, then resized it, and you'd like to
        scatter objects on this plane. If you do so, do not forget to apply the scale of
        your plane with the <span>CTRL+A</span> shortcut, depending if you intend your scatter's to follow your plane 3D transforms, or not.
        This is a step that all Blender users know, and that a lot of beginners are unfortunately missing.
      </p>

      <h2>Properties Descriptions</h2>
      <p>
        Did you know that you can hover on almost any Blender sliders, toggles, or
        drop down items to read their description? We wrote a lot of information in
        these descriptions. Taking time to hover in order to read these descriptions is a good reflex to have!<br><br>No need to see a tutorial or this doc website if all the info you need is already described in there!
        If you feel that some of our items need better descriptions, don't hesitate to contact us and we'll improve them!

      <h2>Compatibility Issues</h2>
      <p>
        Blender does not support forward compatibility! Let's say that your
        collaborator gave you a blend file saved in Blender 3.2, then please avoid
        reading, and <b>never</b> save, this blend file in Blender 3.1 or lower.
        Please follow this simple rule, otherwise,
        <b>you will run into issues.</b><br><br>The blender C++ codes of some data structures, such as
        shader/geometry nodes or modifiers, might change from one version to another, and old blender version might not recorgnize these structure embedded in your .Blend file.
      </p>

      <h2>Basics of Shading</h2>
      <p>
        Do you wish to change the color or shader of a plant your scattered? Great! This can be
        done natively in Blender shader editor, our plugin does not interact with any shaders!
        To change the shaders of the objects you scattered, you will first need to select your object in your scene (this can be easily done by going
        in your instance list, and clicking on the select icon), then open a new Blender shader editor and edit the material.
        <br><br>This assumes that you know the basics of material editing in blender and you know how to navigate in a shader nodetree.
      </p>
      <h3 class="flex_bottomalign">Pro Tip:</h3>
      <p>
        There are handy nodes available in Blender shaders for your instances,
        such as <i>Object info/Random</i> for randomization effects, the
        <i>Geometry/Position</i> or <i>Object info/Location</i> for
        textures, or the <i>Object info/Color</i>, if you'd like to use the<a
          href="#" data-doc="#FeatureOptimization&article_object_display_color_representation">
          scatter-systems display color</a> within your shaders.
      </p>
    </div>

      <h2>What are Instances</h2>
      <p>
        Scattering is based on the technology of instancing! What is instancing?
        Well, instancing is the idea of re-using the data of your object in your computer memory order to
        vastly save on memory and performance.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        It is important to understand the implication of re-using the same mesh
        data, while it is giving us massive benefits in terms of performance, we
        will not be able to run a physic collision or wind simulation that will change the individual meshes of your objects.
        If you want to do so, you'll need to have unique objects with unique meshes.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Instances are like any other objects, they have a position, rotation, or
        scale. In order to define an instance rotation in Geo-Scatter, we are
        aligning the default Z & Y axis of the instance toward a chosen axis. We
        call the upward direction of an instance (+Z) the instance "normal", and
        the forward direction (+Y) the instance "tangent". For example, if you'd
        like your instance's upward direction to follow your emitting surface
        inclination, you will need to align your instance's normals toward the normal of your surface face's.

      <h2>Expectation on your Computer</h2>
      <p>
        3D Beginners might have unrealistic expectations of what is possible to be
        displayed in real-time in Blender viewport because of their experience
        with video games, please make sure to read the page about
        <a href="#" data-doc="#FeatureOptimization">optimization</a>. Geo-Scatter
        has a lot of optimization features, however, it is still
        important to have a good understanding of what your computer or Blender is
        capable of.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Please keep in mind that software such as Blender, Max, or Maya aren't
        games! Games engines are specifically designed to stream polygons at a
        smooth framerate thanks to many tricks happening in the background, most
        of these tricks do <b>not</b> make sense in any 3D creation suite such as blender, where
        the rendering is occurring on a dedicated step of the process, with the power of the path tracing algorithm (such as Cycles render).
      </p>

      <h2>Expectation for Large Landscape</h2>
      <p>
        Working on large-scale landscapes can be tricky in Blender, or any other
        3D creation suite! There are a few habits experienced environmental
        artists acquired in their careers that perhaps beginner 3D artists don't
        have from the get-go.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        For example, always hide scatter-layers you aren't working on. Avoid displaying the hi-res object in the 3Dviewport. Use camera optimization features smartly if you are working with large terrains, as you don't want to generate billions of tiny instances of grass on large areas where you might just get away with a grass material for example.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3 class="flex_bottomalign">Pro Tip:</h3>
      <p>
        If you need tips on how to manage performance, please make sure to read
        the page on
        <a href="#" data-doc="#FeatureOptimization">optimization</a>. Where we overview all display and visibility optimization features.

        <h2>Batch Operation</h2>
        <p>
          In Blender, the property of an active object can be batch applied to the property of the selected objects by pressing the
          <span>ALT</span> key while tweaking the value. This native behavior has
          been smartly re-implemented through our plugin interface. You can batch-change the
          selected scatter-system properties by holding <span>ALT</span> when adjusting one of your slider, toggle, or when assigning a mask or item!
        </p>
        <h3>Warnings:</h3>
        <p>
          Be aware that the <i>3-button mouse emulation </i> option of Blender
          will be in your way when batch-changing properties as this option will
          make the <span>ALT</span> key unavailable.
        </p>

        <h2>Vector Slide</h2>
        <p>
          In Blender, you can drag your mouse on the bottom to change multiple
          vector elements at the same time, this is a very well-known feature that
          few beginners might miss.
        </p>

        <h2>Collection Linking</h2>
        <p>
          Tips you should know about collections:
          <ul>
            <li>
              In Blender, Objects can be linked in multiple collections simultaneously, 
              this can be done by pressing <span>CTRL</span> while drag-and-dropping in the outliner.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can create new "collection-instance" objects your outliner 
              collections, in blender 'Add' menu. The origin of the collection-instance object is the origin
              of the scene. Yes, these objects can be scattered.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Warnings:</h3>
        <p>
          If you want to move objects in the outliner that are already linked in
          other collections, be careful! Because Blender will automatically unlink
          the object from the other collections if you do not hold <span>CTRL</span>. This is a
          native behavior you need to watch for when moving objects in your outliner editor.
        </p>
    </div>

        <h2>Bounding Boxes</h2>
        <p>
          Beginners are often confused with the 'Bounding Box' feature of Blender.
          With this option, you'll display your objects as a wired bounding box only
          in the rasterized viewport & not in the render. This is a per-object
          property located in <span>Properties Editor > Object > viewport display > Display As</span>.
          <br><br>
          This option is useful for heavy-poly objects, where we do not want to see the
          full resolution object within the 3Dviewport as displaying too many polygons in a rasterized view will slow our GPU while working!
        </p>
        <h3 class="flex_bottomalign">Reminder:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If you scattered an item with a bounding box, you can easily select
            the scattered item in the instance subpanel, by clicking on the select icon. 
            Additionally in the plugin manager 'lister' interface, you will find a button to batch change all bounding-box properties of the objects you are scattering.
          </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

        <h2>Flowmaps</h2>
        <p>
          Flowmaps are directional information (vectors) contained in an image
          texture or in a vertex-color layer. The Red/Green channels are
          representing directions in the tangent XY space. The vectors ranging
          from -1 to 1 are remapped between 0 & 1 in order to fit into a RGB color
          information.
          <br><br>
          Flowmaps cannot be painted natively in Blender, the
          <a href="https://clemensbeute.gumroad.com/l/heZDT" target="_blank">flowmap painter addon</a>
          by Clemens Beute is needed. When you use this plugin with Geo-Scatter, make
          sure to use the UV space color theme. <br />As the blue channel is
          unused, there are options in scatter to use the blue channel as a
          strength factor.
        </p>

      <img src="../img/assetb.jpg" alt="" />

        <h2>Using the Asset Browser</h2>
        <p>
          Our plugin heavily benefit and sometimes rely on blender asset-browser. In the 'Create' panel you can scatter the selected assets from your browser, and with the biome system, most biome packs will assume that you have the assets already installed in your asset browser. 
          So you should know how to install a .blend containing assets in your asset browser library! If you don't check out the <a href="#" data-doc="#FeatureInstallation">installation page</a>.
