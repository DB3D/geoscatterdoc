      <h2>ABC's of blender</h2>
      <p>
        Do you understand what is a vertex? what is a UV map and how to create
        simple UV's? How to add/remove modifiers? What is the normal direction of
        a face and its implications on shading? Why you can't
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMIwthFmr-Q" target="_blank">paint a vertex group</a>
        correctly on an N-gon? &nbsp;Great! Let's get started then!&nbsp;
      </p>
    </div>

      <h2>Apply Scales</h2>
      <p>
        Let's say you created a plane in your scene, resized it, and would like to
        start a scatter on this plane. If so, do not forget to apply the scale of
        your object with the <span>CTRL+A</span> shortcut. <br />
        This is a step that all blender users know, and that few beginners might
        miss. Please, if you are a beginner, do not forget about applying scales!
      </p>

      <h2>Properties Descriptions</h2>
      <p>
        Did you know that you can hover on almost any blender sliders, toggles, or
        drop down items to read their description? We pack a lot of information in
        our properties description. Taking time to hover in order to gather
        information is always a good reflex. If you feel that some items need more
        or better descriptions, don't hesitate to contact us.

      <h2>Compatibility Issues</h2>
      <p>
        Blender does not support forward compatibility! Let's say that your
        collaborator gave you a blend file saved in blender 3.2, then please avoid
        reading, and <b>never</b> save, this blend file in blender 3.1 or lower.
        Please follow this simple rule, otherwise
        <b>you will run into issues.</b> Some data structures (such as
        shader/geometry nodes or modifiers) are relying on newly added features,
        and will not be recognized.
      </p>
    </div>

      <h2>Basics of Shading</h2>
      <p>
        Do you wish to change the color of a scattered item? Great! This can be
        done natively in blender shader editor! To do so you will simply need to
        select the scattered item in your scene (this can be easily done by going
        in your instance list, and clicking on the select icon) and open a new
        blender shader editor.
      </p>
      <h3 class="flex_bottomalign">Pro Tip:</h3>
      <p>
        There are handy nodes available in blender shaders for your instances,
        such as <i>Object info/Random</i> for randomization effects, the
        <i>Geometry/Position</i> or <i>Object info/Location</i> for
        textures, or the <i>Object info/Color</i> if you'd like to use the<a
          href="https://sites.google.com/view/scatter5docs/manual/optimization?authuser=0#h.wx3fxb196l65" target="_blank">
          scatter-systems display color</a> within your shaders.
      </p>
    </div>

      <h2>What are Instances</h2>
      <p>
        Scattering is based on the technology of instancing! What is instancing?
        well, it is the idea of re-using the data of your object in order to
        vastly save on memory and performance.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        It is important to understand the implication of re-using the same mesh
        data, while it is giving us massive benefits in terms of performance, we
        will not be able to run a physic collision or wind simulation on instanced
        objects meshes that way unless we make each object unique.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Instances are like any other objects, they have a position, rotation, or
        scale. In order to define an instance rotation in Geo-Scatter, we are
        aligning the default Z & Y axis of the instance toward a chosen axis. We
        call the upward direction of an instance (+Z) the instance "normal", and
        the forward direction (+Y) the instance "tangent". For example, if you'd
        like your instance's upward direction to follow your emitting surface
        inclination, you will need to align your instance's normals toward the
        surface faces normals.

      <h2>Expectation on your Computer</h2>
      <p>
        3D Beginners might have unrealistic expectations of what is possible to be
        displayed in real-time in blender viewport because of their experience
        with video games, please make sure to read the page about
        <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/geoscatter/manual/optimization?authuser=0">optimization</a>. Geo-Scatter
        has a lot of optimization features, however, it is still
        important to have a good understanding of what your computer or blender is
        capable of.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Please keep in mind that software such as Blender, Max, or Maya aren't
        games! Games engines are specifically designed to stream polygons at a
        smooth framerate thanks to many tricks happening in the background, most
        of these tricks do <b>not</b> make sense in any 3D creation software where
        the rendering is occurring on a dedicated step of the process, with the
        power of the path tracing algorithm.
      </p>
    </div>

      <h2>Large Landscape Expectations</h2>
      <p>
        Working on large-scale landscapes can be tricky in blender, or any other
        3D creation suite! There are a few habits experienced environmental
        artists acquired in their careers that perhaps beginner 3D artists do not
        have from the get-go.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        For example, the scattered tiny elements (such as grass) should only be
        present in the foreground of your landscape shot, far-away vistas do not
        need such detail that a good texture could provide, they will only slow
        you down.
      </p>
      <br />

        <h2>Batch Operation</h2>
        <p>
          In Blender, properties of an active object can be batch applied to the
          properties of the selection by pressing the
          <abbr>LT key while tweaking the value.</abbr> This native behavior has
          been smartly implemented in our plugin. You can batch-change the
          selected scatter-system properties by holding <span>ALT</span> when adjusting your
          settings, assigning masks or items, or enabling features!
        </p>
        <h3>Warnings:</h3>
        <p>
          Be aware that the <i>3-button mouse emulation </i> option of blender
          will be in your way when batch-changing properties as this option will
          make the <span>ALT</span> key unavailable.
        </p>

        <h2>Vector Slide</h2>
        <p>
          In blender, you can drag your mouse on the bottom to change multiple
          vector elements at the same time, this is a very well-known feature that
          few beginners might miss.
        </p>

        <h2>Collection Linking</h2>
        <p>
          Tips you should know about collections:
          <ul>
            <li>
              In Blender, Objects can be linked in multiple collections simultaneously, 
              this can be done by pressing <span>CTRL</span> while drag-and-dropping in the outliner.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can create new "collection-instance" objects from these
              collections, the origin of the collection-instance object is the origin
              of the scene. These objects can be scattered.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Pro Tip:</h3>
        <p>
          When you add/remove an object in Geo-Scatter "instancing" panel, in the
          background our plugin will interact with a scatter-system instancing
          collection, these collections are by default stored in the main
          "Geo-Scatter" collection, this collection should remain closed & untouched.
        </p>
        <h3>Warnings:</h3>
        <p>
          If you want to move objects in the outliner that are already linked in
          other collections, be careful! Because blender will automatically unlink
          the object from the other collections if you do not hold <span>CTRL</span>. This is a
          native behavior you need to watch for when managing your collections.
        </p>

        <h2>Bounding Boxes</h2>
        <p>
          Blender beginners are often confused with this native blender feature.
          In blender, it is possible to display your object as a bounding box only
          in the rasterized viewport, not in the render ( this is a per-object
          property located in
          <span>Properties Editor > Object > viewport display > Display As</span>  ).
        </p>
        <p>
          This is useful for trees for example, where we do not want to see the
          full resolution object within the rasterized viewport, as they often
          come with way too many polygons and it might slow us down while working,
          as you may know, rasterized viewport performances slowdowns when dealing
          with a lot of triangles!
        </p>
        <h3 class="flex_bottomalign">Reminder:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If you scattered an item with a bounding box, you can easily select
            the scattered item in the instance subpanel, by clicking on the select
            ig
            collection.
          </li>
          <li>
            Don't forget about the <span>ALT</span> feature, it works everywhere in blender.
          </li>
          <li>
            This is also explained
            <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/scatter5docs/manual/optimization?authuser=0#h.7ncwc0ag66us"

        <h2>Flowmaps</h2>
        <p>
          Flowmaps are directional informations (vectors) contained in an image
          texture or in a vertex-color layer. The Red/Green channels are
          representing directions in the tangent XY space. The vectors ranging
          from -1 to 1 are remapped between 0 & 1 in order to fit into a color
          information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Flowmaps cannot be painted natively in blender, the
          <a href="https://clemensbeute.gumroad.com/l/heZDT" target="_blank">flowmap painter addon</a>
          by Clemens Beute is needed. When you use this plugin with Geo-Scatter, make
          sure to use the UV space color theme. <br />As the blue channel is
          unused, there are options in scatter to use the blue channel as a
          strength factor.
