    <h3>ABC's of blender</h3>
    <p>
      Do you understand what is a vertex? what is a UV map and how to create
      simple UV's? How to add/remove modifiers? What is the normal direction of
      a face and its implications on shading? Why you can't
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMIwthFmr-Q" target="_blank">paint a vertex group</a>
      correctly on an N-gon? &nbsp;Great! Let's get started then!&nbsp;
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="prerequisie_cards pre_sec">
    <img src="../img/pre2.jpg" alt="" />
    <h3>Apply Scales</h3>
    <p>
      Let's say you created a plane in your scene, resized it, and would like to
      start a scatter on this plane. If so, do not forget to apply the scale of
      your object with the CTRL+A shortcut. <br />
      This is a step that all blender users know, and that few beginners might
      miss. Please, if you are a beginner, do not forget about applying scales!
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="prerequisie_cards pre_sec">
    <img src="../img/pre3.jpg" alt="" />
    <h3>Properties Descriptions</h3>
    <p>
      Did you know that you can hover on almost any blender sliders, toggles, or
      drop down items to read their description? We pack a lot of information in
      our properties description. Taking time to hover in order to gather
      information is always a good reflex. If you feel that some items need more
      or better descriptions, don't hesitate to contact us.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="prerequisie_cards pre_sec">
    <img src="../img/pre4.jpg" alt="" />
    <h3>Compatibility Issues</h3>
    <p>
      Blender does not support forward compatibility! Let's say that your
      collaborator gave you a blend file saved in blender 3.2, then please avoid
      reading, and <b>never</b> save, this blend file in blender 3.1 or lower.
      Please follow this simple rule, otherwise
      <b>you will run into issues.</b> Some data structures (such as
      shader/geometry nodes or modifiers) are relying on newly added features,
      and will not be recognized.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="prerequisie_cards pre_sec">
    <img src="../img/pre5.jpg" alt="" />
    <h3>Basics of Shading</h3>
    <p>
      Do you wish to change the color of a scattered item? Great! This can be
      done natively in blender shader editor! To do so you will simply need to
      select the scattered item in your scene (this can be easily done by going
      in your instance list, and clicking on the select icon) and open a new
      blender shader editor.
    </p>
    <h3>Pro Tip:</h3>
    <p>
      There are handy nodes available in blender shaders for your instances,
      such as the <i>"Object info/Random"</i> for randomization effects, the
      <i>"Geometry/Position"</i> or <i>"Object info/Location"</i> &nbsp;for
      textures, or the "Object info/Color" if you'd like to link the<a
        href="https://sites.google.com/view/scatter5docs/manual/optimization?authuser=0#h.wx3fxb196l65" target="_blank">
        scatter-systems display color</a>
      within the shaders.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="prerequisie_cards pre_sec">
    <img src="../img/pre6.jpg" alt="" />
    <h3>What are Instances</h3>
    <p>
      Scattering is based on the technology of instancing! What is instancing?
      well, it is the idea of re-using the data of your object in order to
      vastly save on memory and performance.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      It is important to understand the implication of re-using the same mesh
      data, while it is giving us massive benefits in terms of performance, we
      will not be able to run a physic collision or wind simulation on instanced
      objects meshes that way unless we make each object unique.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Instances are like any other objects, they have a position, rotation, or
      scale. In order to define an instance rotation in Scatter5, we are
      aligning the default Z & Y axis of the instance toward a chosen axis. We
      call the upward direction of an instance (+Z) the instance "normal", and
      the forward direction (+Y) the instance "tangent". For example, if you'd
      like your instance's upward direction to follow your emitting surface
      inclination, you will need to align your instance's normals toward the
      surface faces normals.
    </p>

    <h3>What to Expect from Blender & Your Computer</h3>
    <p>
      3D Beginners might have unrealistic expectations of what is possible to be
      displayed in real-time in blender viewport because of their experience
      with video games, please make sure to read the page about
      <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/geoscatter/manual/optimization?authuser=0">optimization</a>. Geo-Scatter
      has a lot of optimization features, however, it is still
      important to have a good understanding of what your computer or blender is
      capable of.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Please keep in mind that software such as Blender, Max, or Maya aren't
      games! Games engines are specifically designed to stream polygons at a
      smooth framerate thanks to many tricks happening in the background, most
      of these tricks do <b>not</b> make sense in any 3D creation software where
      the rendering is occurring on a dedicated step of the process, with the
      power of the path tracing algorithm.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="prerequisie_cards pre_sec">

    <h3>Large Landscape Expectations</h3>
    <p>
      Working on large-scale landscapes can be tricky in blender, or any other
      3D creation suite! There are a few habits experienced environmental
      artists acquired in their careers that perhaps beginner 3D artists do not
      have from the get-go.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      For example, the scattered tiny elements (such as grass) should only be
      present in the foreground of your landscape shot, far-away vistas do not
      need such detail that a good texture could provide, they will only slow
      you down.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      If you need tips on how to manage performance, please make sure to read
      the page on

      <h3>Batch Operation</h3>
      <p>
        In Blender, properties of an active object can be batch applied to the
        properties of the selection by pressing the
        <abbr>LT key while tweaking the value.</abbr> This native behavior has
        been smartly implemented in our plugin. You can batch-change the
        selected scatter-system properties by holding ALT when adjusting your
        settings, assigning masks or items, or enabling features!
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Important:</h3>
      <p>
        Be aware that the <i>3-button mouse emulation </i> option of blender
        will be in your way when batch-changing properties as this option will
        make the ALT key unavailable.

      <h3>Vector Slide</h3>
      <p>
        In blender, you can drag your mouse on the bottom to change multiple
        vector elements at the same time, this is a very well-known feature that
        few beginners might miss.
      </p>

        <div class="video_desc_fea">
      <h3>Collection Linking & Collection Instances</h3>
      <p>
        There are two things you should know about collections before getting
        started:
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        1. Objects can be linked in multiple collections simultaneously, this
        can be done by pressing CTRL while drag-and-dropping in the outliner.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. You can create new "collection-instance" objects from these
        collections, the origin of the collection-instance object is the origin
        of the scene. These objects can be scattered.
      </p>
      <h3>Pro Tip:</h3>
      <p>
        When you add/remove an object in Scatter5 "instancing" panel, in the
        background, Scatter5 will interact with a scatter-system instancing
        collection, these collections are by default stored in the main
        "Scatter5" collection, that should remain closed & untouched.
      </p>
      <h3>Be Careful:</h3>
      <p>
        If you want to move objects in the outliner that are already linked in
        other collections, be careful! Because blender will automatically unlink
        the object from the other collections if you do not hold CTRL. This is a
        native behavior you need to watch for when managing your collections.
      </p>

      <h3>Bounding Boxes</h3>
      <p>
        Blender beginners are often confused with this native blender feature.
        In blender, it is possible to display your object as a bounding box only
        in the rasterized viewport, not in the render ( this is a per-object
        property located in
        <i>Properties Editor > Object > viewport display > Display As ).</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is useful for trees for example, where we do not want to see the
        full resolution object within the rasterized viewport, as they often
        come with way too many polygons and it might slow us down while working,
        as you may know, rasterized viewport performances slowdowns when dealing
        with a lot of triangles!
      </p>
      <h3 style="margin: 10px">Reminder:</h3>
      <ul style="margin-left: 15px">
        <li style="list-style-type: square; padding: 6px">
          If you scattered an item with a bounding box, you can easily select
          the scattered item in the instance subpanel, by clicking on the select
          icon. It will select the item stored in the scatter-system instancing
          collection.
        </li>
        <li style="list-style-type: square; padding: 6px">
          Don't forget about the ALT feature, it works everywhere in blender.

      <h3>Flowmaps</h3>
      <p>
        Flowmaps are directional informations (vectors) contained in an image
        texture or in a vertex-color layer. The Red/Green channels are
        representing directions in the tangent XY space. The vectors ranging
        from -1 to 1 are remapped between 0 & 1 in order to fit into a color
        information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Flowmaps cannot be painted natively in blender, the
        <a href="https://clemensbeute.gumroad.com/l/heZDT" target="_blank">flowmap painter addon</a>
        by Clemens Beute is needed. When you use this plugin with Scatter5, make
        sure to use the UV space color theme. <br />As the blue channel is
        unused, there are options in scatter to use the blue channel as a
        strength factor.
