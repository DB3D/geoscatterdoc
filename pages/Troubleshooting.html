          There's a chance that you forgot to also install the associated asset library in your blender asset browser.<br>Most reports we recieve are related to this omission. IF you are unsure if you installed your biome pack correctly, please read the installation page or see our tutorial.
        </li>
        <li>
          There's a small percentage of chance that there's a name conflict, for example, a creator created a biome that relies on "rock.blend", but this name is already taken in your asset library & therefore the assets cannot be found. 
          We always insist with biome creators to ensure their .blend naming are unique, however sometimes mistakes happens. A simple solution to this problem is to set a custom enrironment path in your plugin preferences. Check out the installation page for more information about this functionality.

            Did you have a forward compatibility issue perhaps? <br />
            Please be careful when switching Blender version while working on your
            projects, it could corrupt your files forever. The best demeanor when working with 3Dsofwares is to stick to the same blender and plugins versions from start to finish.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          Please verify if your system(s) are visible in
          <span>Npanel > Tweak > SystemList</span>. You should see a screen icon activated.
        </li>
        <li>
          Please verify in your outliner if some of your scatter-collections or 'scatter_obj' are
          not hidden.<br>To do so, first make sure to enable all outliner restriction filters. In
          Blender, there are many ways an object can be hidden in the outliner,
          most of the time this is done by <b>mistakenly hitting the horizontal numberpad of your keyboard</b>, as this will hide collections in your outliner.
        </li>
        <li>
          In <span>Tweak > Distribution</span> make sure that the distribution density is not too small, relatively to the size of your terrain.
        </li>
        <li>
          You might want to apply your terrain scale, perhaps it's scale is very big.
          Alternatively in <span>Tweak > Scale > DefaultScale</span>, you could set the
          default scale reference to "global".
        </li>
        <li>
          Please verify if your scatter-system has any designated instances. In
          <span>Npanel > Tweak > Instancing</span>. If no instances are chosen and no display as options are activated, then we'll display nothing as there's nothing to be instanciated.
        </li>
        <li>
          Please inspect the features you have enabled for your system or system-group. Perhaps one of them is not tweaked correctly and therefore masking out everything.
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Most of the time the ecosystems feature might be the culprit, if you
            create relations with a system hidden or that does not exist
            anymore.
          </li>
          <li>A visibility feature might be responsible.</li>

      <ul class="faq-answer">
        <li>
          By default your scatter-system(s) will have a scale relative to the scale of yoursurface(s), it means
          that if your surface has a scale of <span>[100,100,100]</span>, your scattered
          instances will be x100 as larger than the scene unit. To resolve this
          issue you have two possible solutions:
        </li>
         <ul>
          <li>Apply the scale of your surfaces with <span>CTRL + A</span></li>
          <li>
            Set your scatter default scale to "global" space instead of the "local" surface space, this is located in <span>Tweak > Scale > Default Scale</span>.
          </li>
          </ul>
        <li>
          Make sure the scale of the instances you assigned yo your scatters are set to <span>[1,1,1]</span> (to
          easily retrieve your original instance go in <span>Tweak > Instancing</span> &
          click on the select icon).
        </li>
        <li>
          Make sure you are working in the correct scene scale, Blender
          beginners often forgot to follow Blender native scape, 1 Blender unit
          is 1 meter. With our plugin, a unit of 1 will always be 1m.
        </li>
        <li>
          Optionally you can change the default scale of your instance in
        <span>Tweak > Scale > Default Scale</span>.

      <ul class="faq-answer">
        <li>
          If the scattered instances are not displaying an accurate color,
          that's probably because you did not create the shaders of the objects
          scattered, is that correct?
          <b>If the objects you are using are indeed created by someone else,
            the shaders surely rely on the display color Blender property to
            drive the color in render</b>, this is possible thanks to the object info node used by
          Cycles/Eevee render engines.<br />

          In Geo-Scatter you are able to tweak the display color of your scatter
          via <span>N Panel > Geo-Scatter > Tweaking > System(s) List</span>. Please
          consult the creator of the model used to verify if/how the display
          color property is being used. If you are using botaniq, consult this
          page.

        <h2 class="faq-question faq_titltt">Problems when switching Blender versions</h2>
        <i class="faq-icon fa fa-angle-down"></i>
      </div>
      <ul class="faq-answer">
        <li>
          As you may know, the Geo-Scatter plugin is based on "Geometry-node". Geometry-node may vary from one version of Blender to another, meaning that it is important to be careful
          when changing Blender versions, please take the following pieces of
          advice into consideration when switching from one Blender version to
          another:
        </li>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>
            First of all, please be aware that changing your software version
            mid-project is a bad demeanor. Please avoid doing so or you will have problems sooner or
            later, with your blender shaders or with the plugins you are using.
            <b>Always stick to using the same version of your software from the
              beginning to the end of your project</b>. Additionally, make sure to document which software version your project was made
            on to avoid corrupting any Blender files by opening & saving your
            project in the wrong version later. If you really need to upgrade your
            software version make sure to save a copy of your project beforehand.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Avoid at all cost forward-compatibility errors, or you might
              corrupt your project forever</b>. Blender '.blend' files are not forward-compatible! Unsure what forward
            compatibility means? Here's an example: You are working on a project
            made in Blender 3.2, and your collaborator join-in & starts to work on
            the same .blend file but in Blender 3.4. A few days later you re-open
            your projects in Blender 3.2 and surprise, all your shaders node-trees are corrupted,
            all color-mix nodes suddenly became "undefined", because the internal
            code of these nodes changed in Blender 3.4. In conclusion, never open
            & save a .blend file made in a newer version in an older version,
            it's your job as an artistu to manage your Blender version clearly, especially when working as a team.
          </li>
          <li>
            Please make sure the plugins you are using are compatible with your
            Blender version. Do not assume a Blender plugin is compatible with all
            Blender versions, it is a common wrong assumption. You will find compatibility information about each of our plugin versions in our Changelogs page.
          </li>
          <li>
            When upgrading your Geo-Scatter plugin, all scatter-system(s)
            you created with our plugin in your project will need to be updated.
            As we explained above it is not advised to switch your software
            version mid-project but if you really need to: Click on the "update
            node-tree" button to update all internal geometry-node system(s) we
            are using. Additionally, you are able to force update all node-trees
            in the Geo-Scatter plugin preferences, in the "debug" area. If you
            encounter errors while updating, restart your Blender session. Still
            not working? Please contact us with a link to your file.

          We advise being more familiar with a native Blender option called
          'objects-displays'. It is a very important optimization feature located
          per object properties, it will potentially save your computer from
          crashing. This option is located in <span>Properties Editor > Object > Viewport Display > Display As</span>.
          Our plugins might enable this Blender option automatically if the
          object you are trying to scatter is very heavy in terms of polycount. If you do not like
          this security behavior you are able to disable it in <span>N
          Panel > Geo-Scatter > Create</span>, in the behavior popover menu, located next
          to any creating operator button.

          It is very likely that you have a <b>modifier</b> on one of your
          surfaces that is changing the mesh topology during the render. In most
          cases, the culprit is a <b>subdivision modifier!</b>
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Please make sure that your modifier has the same level of subdivision within the viewport &
            within the render.
          </li>
          <li>
            Note that if your surface is very high-poly, you could use a
            low-poly surface invisible on render only used for the scattering.
            This trick will be needed if you'd like to work with materials with adaptive displacement.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          Perhaps you have a collection or an object in your scene with a
          different viewport/render state?
        </li>
        <li>
          Perhaps you have an optimization feature in <span>Tweak > Visibility</span> on one of your system
          enabled only for the viewport? The icons next to the visibility features dictates their status during viewport / rendered view / final render.

      <ul class="faq-answer">
        <li>
          Are you beginning in 3d? Perhaps you have false expectations on what
          Blender/your computer is capable of doing. Unsure where to start? here
          are some questions you can overview:
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Is your computer able to handle large Blender 3D scenes? Did you ever
            work on large 3D scenes in Blender/Maya/3Dsmax in the past? Or perhaps
            this is your first time creating environment scenes? Then perhaps the slowdowns you are facing are
            completely normal, your scene might just be really heavy for your
            GPU to draw or for Blender to compute.
          </li>
          <li>
            How many points are you initially scattering? More than a million? Is
            your scatter area very large? <br />
            <b>Solution:</b> Use visibility optimization features, hide your
            unused scatter-system(s) in the viewport, and separate your
            scatter-surface in foreground /middle-ground /background.
          </li>
          <li>
            Is there an extreme amount of triangles drawn on your screens? Blender
            is using rasterization to render the viewport, this rendering
            technique will scale depending on the number of triangles displayed.
            Check our out optimization page for more useful information. <br />
            <b>Solution:</b> Use display optimization (display as point is the
            fastest option). Hide your unused scatter-system(s) in the viewport.
          </li>
          <li>
            Is the surface you are scattering upon high poly? perhaps with
            heavy-to-compute modifiers enabled? br
            <b>Solution:</b> Use a low poly invisible surface only used as a
            scattering surface, you can keep your high poly mesh for the
            final render.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          Did you know that <b>some features might be slower than others!</b> For
          example:
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The random distribution mode with limit distance enabled is slower
            than the original random distribution mode
          </li>
          <li>
            Any features using proximity calculation such as <span>Tweak > Proximity</span> or
          <span>Tweak > Ecosystems</span> are computer intensive, especially when calculating
            proximity with high poly meshes.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          If you believe your scene is unusually slow compared to another similar Blender environment scene, please contact us maybe you found a bug!
          Our plugin is/should be highly optimized and we did an abundance of research on the subject. Note that an easy way to see if the slowdowns are related to our
           plugin, is to disable the plugin in your addon preferences and see if the slowdowns persist.

        First of all, make sure the Blender version your collaborator or render farm is using is the exact same version as yours!
      </li>
      <li>
        Be aware of any linked data or images in your blend file. If you have linked any objects or collections or materials in your scene, your render-farm or collaborator might have missing libraires from their ends.
      </li>
      <li>
        If your collaborator/render farm also has installed the same version of Geo-Scatter or Biome-Reader they should be able to read your scatters with no issues.<br>If not:
      </li>
      <ul><ul>
        <li>
          When you scatter something with our plugin, it will append a geometry-node modifier on a newly created 'scatter_obj'. Therefore your renderfarm or friends should be able to read your scatter with no problems, except for the following exceptions:
        </li>
        <ul>
        <li>
          When animating any of our plugin interface properties via keyframes or drivers, it will require our plugin to be installed and activated to be animated. 
          If you want to ship animated scatters to a render node or collaborator that doesn't have our plugin installed, you will need to animate the equivalent 
          properties of the Geometry-node engine located on your 'scatter_obj' objects.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you are using features related to the active camera, please set the camera update method to 'real-time' before sharing your .blend file. 
        </li>
        <li>
          If you are using features related to the active camera and your camera has animated lenses or resolution, you will either need to disable the related feature altogether, 
          or animate the camera info matrix values in the Geometry-node modifier of the equivalent 'scatter_obj'
        </li>
        <li>
          Note that any display or visibility features that are automatically being turned off during rendered view won't work if our plugin isn't installed.
        </li>
      </ul></ul>
    </ul>
    <li>
      if you have any doubt, for a guaranteed result, use the <i>"export as instance"</i> functionality available in our plugin extra panel, this will bake the scatter-system(s) as real Blender instances. Unfortunately any kind of animated effects won't be supported.

        <b>No</b>. Our 'plugin' isn't technically one. When you use our Geo-Scatter product, you are using a Geometry-node object

        you can, however you'll need to make sure to remove our copyright file located at <span>PluginFolder \ blends \ engine.blend</span> from your redistributed projects. Additionally, Geo-Scatter® is a protected trademarked,
        you'll need to avoid using or mentioning the Geo-Scatter® brand in your redistributed projects as well. More information available on our <a href="https://geoscatter.com/legal.html" target="_blank">legal page</a>.
