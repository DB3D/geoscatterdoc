          Please verify in your outliner if some of your scatter-collections are
          not hidden. ( Make sure to enable all outliner restriction filters, in
          blender, there are many ways an object can be hidden in the outliner,
          most of the time this is done by
          <b>mistakenly hitting the horizontal numberpad of your keyboard )</b>

          In <i>"Tweak>Distribution"</i> make sure that the distribution density

        <li>
          You might want to apply your terrain scale, perhaps it is very big.
          Alternatively in <i>"Tweak>Scale>DefaultScale"</i> you could set the
          default scale reference to <i>"global" </i>
        </li>
        <li>
          Please verify if your system(s) are visible in
          "Npanel>Tweak>SystemList". You should see a screen icon activated.
        </li>
        <li>
          Please verify if your scatter-system has any designated instances. In
          "Npanel>Tweak>Instancing". No instances equal nothing displayed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Please disable all features, perhaps one of them is not tweaked

        <li>
          By default the scatter will be parented to your surface(s), it means
          that if your surface has a scale of [100,100,100], your scattered
          instances will be x100 as larger than the scene unit. To resolve this
          issue you have two possible solutions:
        </li>
        <li class="faq_nested_li">Apply the scale of your surface with <span>CTRL+A</span></li>
        <li class="faq_nested_li">
          Set your scatter default scale to "global" space instead of the
          "local" surface space, this is located in "Tweak>Scale>Default Scale".
        </li>
        <li>
          Make sure the scale of the instances you chose is set to [1,1,1] (to
          easily retrieve your original instance go in "Tweak>Instancing" &
          click on the select icon).
        </li>
        <li>
          Make sure you are working in the correct scene scale, blender
          beginners often forgot to follow blender native scape, 1 blender unit
          is 1 meter.
        </li>
        <li>
          Optionally you can change the default scale of your instance in
          "Tweak>Scale>Default Scale"

      <ul class="faq-answer">
        <li>
          If the scattered instances are not displaying an accurate color,
          that's probably because you did not create the shaders of the objects
          scattered, is that correct?
          <b>If the objects you are using are indeed created by someone else,
            the shaders surely rely on the display color blender property to
            drive the color in render</b>, this is possible thanks to the object info node used by
          Cycles/Eevee render engines. <br /><br />

          In Geo-Scatter you are able to tweak the display color of your scatter
          via 'N Panel > Geo-Scatter > Tweaking > System(s) List'. Please
          consult the creator of the model used to verify if/how the display
          color property is being used. If you are using botaniq, consult this
          page.

      </div>
      <ul class="faq-answer">
        <li>
          As you may know, the Geo-Scatter plugin is based on the very efficient
          <i>"Geometry-node" </i> system. Geometry-node may vary from one
          blender version to another, meaning that it is important to be careful
          when changing blender versions, please take the following pieces of
          advice into consideration when switching from one blender version to
          another:
        </li>
        <li class="faq_nested_li">
          First of all, please be aware that changing your software version
          mid-project is a bad demeanor in the CG industry, regardless of our
          plugin. Please avoid doing so or you will have problems sooner or
          later,
          <b>always prefer using the same version of your software from the
            beginning to the end of your project</b>. Make sure to document which software version your project was made
          in to avoid corrupting any blender files by opening & saving your
          project in the wrong version. If you really need to upgrade your
          software version make sure to save a copy of your project beforehand.
        </li>
        <li class="faq_nested_li">
          <b>Avoid at all cost forward-compatibility errors, or you might
            corrupt your project forever</b>, as .blend files are not forward-compatible! Unsure what forward
          compatibility means? Here's an example: You are working on a project
          made in blender 3.2, and your collaborator join-in & starts to work on
          the same .blend file but in blender 3.4. A few days later you re-open
          your projects and surprise, all your shaders node-trees are corrupted,
          all color-mix nodes suddenly became "undefined", because the internal
          code of these nodes changed in blender 3.4. In conclusion, never open
          & save a .blend file made in a newer version in an older version,
          manage your blender version clearly.
        </li>
        <li class="faq_nested_li">
          Please make sure the plugins you are using are compatible with your
          blender version. Do not assume a blender plugin is compatible with all
          blender versions, it is a common wrong assumption.
        </li>
        <li class="faq_nested_li">
          When upgrading your Geo-Scatter plugin version, all scatter-system(s)
          you created with our plugin in your project will need to be updated.
          As we explained above it is not advised to switch your software
          version mid-project but if you really need to: click on the "update
          node-tree" button to update all internal geometry-node system(s) we
          are using. Additionally, you are able to force update all node-trees
          in the Geo-Scatter plugin preferences, in the "debug" area. If you
          encounter errors while updating, restart your blender session. Still
          not working? Please contact us with a link to your file via the
          blendermarket direct-messaging system.

          We advise being more familiar with a native blender option called
          objects-displays. It is a very important optimization feature located
          per object properties, it will potentially save your computer from
          crashing. <br />
          The Geo-Scatter might enable this blender option automatically if the
          object you are trying to scatter is very heavy. If you do not like
          this security behavior you are able to disable it in 'N
          Panel>Geo-Scatter>Create', in the behavior popover menu, located next
          to any creating operator button.

          It is very likely that you have a <b>modifier</b> on one of your
          surfaces that is changing its topology only in the render. In most
          cases, the culprit is a <b>subdivision modifier!</b>
        </li>
        <li class="faq_nested_li">
          Please make sure to have the same level of subdivision on viewport &
          on render for your subdiv modifier.
        </li>
        <li class="faq_nested_li">
          Note that if your emitting surface is very high-poly, you could use a
          low-poly surface invisible on render only used for the scattering.
          This trick will be needed if you'd like to work with materials that
          have adaptive displacement enabled for example.
        </li>
        <li>
          Perhaps you have a collection or an object in your scene with a
          different viewport/render state?
        </li>
        <li>
          Perhaps you have an optimization feature on one of your systems

        <li>
          Because any scatter-system can be read & rendered on any other PC
          without having the Geo-Scatter plugin installed, it shouldn't pose a
          problem to render your scene. However we do advise disabling any
          display or visibility optimization just in case.
        </li>
        <li>
          Note that any keyframe/driver animation will need our plugin to be
          activated.
        </li>
        <li>
          if you have any doubt, for a guaranteed result, use the "export as
          instance" functionality available in our plugin extra panel, this will
          non-destructively bake the scatter-system(s) as real blender
          instances.

          Perhaps you are beginning in 3d & have false expectations about what
          blender/your computer is capable of doing? Unsure where to start? here
          are some questions you should ask yourself:
        </li>
        <li class="faq_nested_li">
          Is your computer able to handle large blender 3D scenes? Did you ever
          work on large 3D scenes in blender/maya/3Dsmax in the past? Or perhaps
          this is your first time creating large scenes? Perhaps the slowdown is
          completely normal, your scene might just be really heavy for your
          computer.
        </li>
        <li class="faq_nested_li">
          How many points are you initially scattering, more than a million? Is
          your scatter area very large? <br />
          <b>Solution:</b> Use visibility optimization features, hide your
          unused scatter-system(s) in the viewport, separate your
          scatter-surface in foreground /middleground /background.
        </li>
        <li class="faq_nested_li">
          Is there an extreme amount of triangles drawn on your screens? Blender
          is using rasterization to render the viewport, this rendering
          technique will scale depending on the number of triangles displayed.
          See basics of computer graphics. <br />
          <b>Solution:</b> Use display optimization (display as point is the
          fastest option). hide your unused scatter-system(s) in the viewport.
        </li>
        <li class="faq_nested_li">
          Is the surface you are scattering upon high poly? perhaps with
          heavy-to-compute modifiers enabled? br
          <b>Solution:</b> Use a low poly invisible surface only used as a
          scattering surface, you can keep your high poly mesh for the
          rendering.
        </li>
        <li>
          Note that <b>some features might be slower than others!</b> For
          example:
        </li>
        <li class="faq_nested_li">
          The random distribution mode with limit distance enabled is slower
          than the original random distribution mode
        </li>
        <li class="faq_nested_li">
          Any features using proximity calculation such as "Tweak>Proximity" or
          "Tweak>Ecosystems" are computer intensive, especially when calculating
          proximity with high poly meshes.
        </li>
        <li class="faq_nested_li">
          Display as convex-hull, bounding-box, or point-cloud might be more
          computer-intensive, as these methods will be constructing the display
          object on the fly.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>If you believe your scene is unusually slow compared to a native
            blender environment scene, please contact us</b>
          maybe you found a bug! Our plugin is/shall be highly optimized and we
          did an abundance of research on the subject.
