      <p>
        We all saw these very impressive unreal engine 5 demos where a gazillion
        triangles are being streamed into the viewport with absolutely no lag
        whatsoever! If you are new to 3D, you might assume that this level of
        performance can be achieved in any 3D app viewport, after all, 3D apps
        only use clay render, few billions of tris are easy to display. Right?
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        It is time to adjust your expectation if this is the case! Performances
        are heavily dependent on your utilization and on the software & hardware
        you are using. Please remember, a 3D package, is not supposed to be a video-game like experience
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="flex_singlecard card3x" style="text-align: justify;">
      <p>
        While UE5 is a fantastic piece of technology, its sole purpose is being
        able to run in real-time, where stable performance is the key focus of
        developers, sometimes at the cost of creative "budgets", limitations, and
        time-consuming or inconvenient workflow.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Blender (& its 3D DCC siblings such as Max/ Maya/ Modo), is <b>not</b> a
        real-time application, it is a digital content creation tool (alias DCC),
        where rendering is done separately during a dedicated part of the process.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        This in return gives us way more creative freedom as the final render can
        be computed during an indefinite amount of time, compared to being
        restrained to a stable framerate. But, as a tradeoff, we the artists, will
        need to be smart on how we preview and manage our heavy scenes when
        working in the viewport.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="flex_singlecard card3x" style="text-align: justify;">
      <p>
        You might assume that the best solution to make blender viewport faster is
        using game-engine-like optimization tricks!
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        I'm sorry to inform you that this is a common misconception.
        Distance-based LOD for example, is one of such technology quite demanded
        by blender users. Implementing such an inconvenient trick does not make
        much sense in a non-real-time rendering app.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        The best and most optimal, and easy-to-use approach is to simply display a
        placeholder (a replacement object only meant for visual representation) in
        your viewport, and render the full-resolution asset only during the final
        render.

      <h2>Rasterization Slowdowns</h2>
      <p>
        The viewports (more precisely "solid"/ "wireframe"/ "material"/ "overlay"
        options) of blender is running on a rendering algorithm called
        "Rasterization". It's the same technology used by Eevee or games. This
        algorithm is extremely fast to compute, however, it does not scale well
        with high polycount. On the contrary, ray-tracers such as CyclesX do not
        care about polycount that much. Such ray-tracing algorithms scale
        depending on the number of rays bouncing in the scene, they can handle
        renders with multiple billions of tris with ease (see
        <a href="https://youtu.be/Qf5dho10OfI?t=560" target="_blank">cg geek demo</a>) however, ray tracers are not a
        viable solution for working in the
        viewport yet (except in ClarisseIFX for example) so we'll need to be
        careful about what we decide to display.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Let's talk about numbers. For reference, when scattering a 5.000 poly
        object with my 2080 GPU, my viewport will start to become laggy when
        displaying 100.000 instances, and become completely frozen around 500.000
        instances. (Reminder: to get informed about your scene object-count,
        enable the statistics overlay in the viewport header -> overlay menu ).
        CyclesX ray-traced rendered view will just do fine!
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>Pro Tip:</h3>
      <p>
        Be aware that enabling the viewport overlay effect has an
        impact on the performance as it is doing rasterization in the background.
        Also, note that the viewport shadows or ambient occlusion options make
        blender considerably slower!
      </p>
    </div>

      <img src="../img/opt1.jpg" alt="" />
      <h2>Scatter-Engine Slowdowns</h2>
      <p>
        As you may know already, Scatter5 is based on a geometry-node engine, it
        is currently the fastest method available for us, blender plugin
        developers. Geometry-node is quite fast by nature! If you avoid hitting
        viewport rasterization slowdowns, by for example using the display as a
        point feature, the next logical slowdown you will be facing is the
        calculation done by the Scatter-Engine itself. Depending on your update
        dependencies and the feature you are using, around +-5.000.000 points are
        manageable when working live in the viewport.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        What are update dependencies? Well, it is when an element in your scene or
        in the UI will trigger a recalculation, when for example, changing a
        slider values will trigger a recalculation of the scatter, and so does
        moving elements tied to a scatter-system such as an emitter, a chosen
        surface, camera, or an object inside a proximity feature collection for
        example.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>Pro Tip:</h3>
      <p>
        Note that using a dedicated
        <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/scatter5docs/manual/scattering?authuser=0#h.t04ee4l83qa7"
          target="_blank">empty emitter </a>will make things faster to compute on big scenes for blender when
        tweaking slider.
      </p>

      <h2>Memory Limit?</h2>
      <p>
        If you want to scare a 3d artist, the best way to proceed is to display a
        message in his interface telling him he ran out of memory! However, this
        is unlikely to happen in a scattering workflow, because scattering is
        using a memory-efficient object duplication technique that I am sure you
        are familiar with, called "Instancing". Internally, the mesh & texture
        information of your object will be re-used in memory. So no worries with
        memory usage when working with Scatter5.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="flex_singlecard card3x" style="text-align: justify;">
      <img src="../img/opt2.jpg" alt="" />
      <h2>High Poly Surfaces Slowdowns</h2>
      <p>
        Scatter is quite forgiving regarding your chosen surfaces polycount, but
        not blender! Vertex color painting, weight painting, and texture painting
        will be slow when approaching 200.000 verts.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Fortunately, there's a way to avoid this, by using two distinct terrain
        objects instead of one: one invisible low-poly version you will use for
        scattering & painting, and another high-res version only used for the
        final render.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Be warned that it is not a good idea to use a subsurf modifier on your
        emitting surface as it may reset the seed of your scatter-system(s) and
        slow down your scene.
      </p>

      <br><br><br>

      <img src="../img/opt4.jpg" alt="" />
      <h2>Instance Limit?</h2>
      <p>
        The brand new CyclesX also has limits, you'll be able to render up to 30
        million instances before the initialization time, canceling time, and RAM
        consumption becomes too heavy. I believe this limit will be improved upon
        a later release, after all, CyclesX is still brand new (writing this in
        2021).
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Other rendering engines, such as Octane, might have a different limit.
        Note that the Scatter plugin and geometry node are compatible with
        external render engines of course.

        <p>
          When working on a large sceneries with a lot of scatter-systems, it is a
          good practice to hide what you do not need to visualize in real time by
          turning off the viewport display (screen icon). The system will always
          appear on the final render if the render toggle is enabled.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Reminder:</h3>
        <p>
          There's a handy shortcut to quickly isolate a scatter-layer: holding ALT
          when clicking in the system list.

          If you ever recieved a message warning you that you have created millions

          your own safety, perhaps it's best to be careful! Accidentally un-hiding

          One of the inconveniences of the camera clipping/culling feature is the
          recalculation of the scattered point for each camera move. This
          recalculation might become sluggish in some scenes. If you start hitting
          such a slowdown, you can change the camera update behavior.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In the example hereby, the update method is set on 'Halt' mode, the

        <h2>Display As Feature</h2>
        <p>
          The "Display As" feature will let you represent your high poly instance with
          a more efficient drawing solution, there are multiple methods available at
          your disposal, and some are more efficient than others:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Bounding Box:</b> Will display the solid bounding box of your
            instances.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b> Convex Hull: </b> Will display the convex-hull geometry of your instances. Be
            aware that this option is heavier to calculate!
          </li>
          <li>
            <b> Placeholder:</b> Replace your instances with one object available in a
            predefined list. Note that some placeholders in this list are handy for
            visualizing rotation and alignment settings.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Custom Placeholder</b>: Replace your instances with the given object.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Single Point:</b> Replace your instances with a single point at its origin.
            Points are extremely fast to rasterize, blender can display millions of
            them with no slowdown in the viewport.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Point-Cloud:</b> Replace your instances with a generated group of points,
            ideal to have a good representation of the final render-shape.
            this display method is quite promising, however,
            <a href="https://developer.blender.org/T93245" target="_blank">T93245</a> 
            <a href="https://developer.blender.org/T92963" target="_blank">T92963</a>
            are important issues that need to be solved, right now this display

          Here's a tip! In the header popover menu of the display feature, click on "show systems colors" to have an
          accurate representation of your scatter-system assigned color within the viewport! This operator will simply put
          the shading on "solid", and set the shading color on "object".

        <h2>Inaccurate Render Color?</h2>
        <p>
          If your rendered object color is not the same once scattered, that's probably because your object (that you
          probably bought online?) is using the 'display color' property as a color influence in its materials shader,
          meaning that the display color is not used only for viewport display purpose but will also have an impact in the
          render. If you have this problem, simply change the display color in Scatter5 system list are.

        <h3>Display As & Biomes</h3>
        <p>
          This feature can be encoded within a biome file. Thanks to this implementation, you can activate the display
          feature when scattering a biome, this option is located in the biome manager Header>Option menu.

        <p>
          Having multiple 3D viewports in your scene is problematic for rendered view feature, it is
          impossible for us to enable a feature only for N viewport space.

        <p>
          The bounding box display is a native per-object setting located in Object Properties &gt; Viewport Display &gt;
          Display As. Sometimes the object you are scattering may have the bounding-box display enabled, either because the
          scattered object has this setting active, or because an <a

          the item in your scene, then you will be able to change the option in the object property. However, be warned, it
